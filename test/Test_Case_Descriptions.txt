Test cases will be graded as follows:
	2 points for correct output
	1-2 points for mostly correct output
	0-1 points for partially correct output
	0 points for no output / can not run

Test1.txt
A simple test case with a .txt extension to test that your
compiler only accepts .lol files.

Test2.lol
A simple test case containing only locode annotations (i.e., 
no variable tags) to test that the compiler works properly for a
simple case.  

Test3.lol
A simple test case containing only locode annotations (i.e., 
no variable tags) with some annotations in lower case to test 
that the compiler is not case sensitive. Also includes bold text. 

Test4.lol
A simple test case containing invalid locode annotations to
test that the lexical analyzer recognizes unknown lexemes and
reports them as lexical errors. Should not produce html.

Test5.lol
A simple test case with a syntax error. Should report error and 
not generate a test case. 

Test6.lol
A simple test case containing a single variable to resolve.

Test7.lol
A test case to with an undefined variable to test that the 
compiler detects the use of an unknown variable. Should
report a static semantic error and not generate HTML.

Test8.lol 
A test case to test the static variable scoping.

Test9.lol
A test case using multiple variable definition and use tags to 
ensure that the parser can handle multiple variables.

Test10.lol
A test case with a video.
